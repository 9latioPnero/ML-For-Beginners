Gitanos Andaluces is a flamenco piece composed by the legendary guitarist Paco de Lucia. It is a bulerias, which is a fast and rhythmic style of flamenco that originated in the Andalusian region of Spain. The title means "Andalusian Gypsies", and it reflects Paco de Lucia's admiration for the gypsy culture and music that influenced his own style.
 
The piece was recorded in 1981 for the album Castro Marin, which also featured John McLaughlin and Larry Coryell on guitars. It showcases Paco de Lucia's virtuosity, creativity and mastery of flamenco techniques, such as rasgueado, picado, alzapua and tremolo. The piece is divided into two sections: the first one is based on a traditional bulerias melody, while the second one introduces a more modern and jazz-like harmony.

## Paco de Lucia: A Flamenco Legend
 
Paco de Lucia was born Francisco Sanchez Gomez in 1947 in Algeciras, a town in the province of Cadiz, Spain. He was the youngest of five children, and his father, Antonio Sanchez, was a flamenco guitarist who taught him how to play from an early age. Paco de Lucia showed a natural talent and passion for the guitar, and he soon began to perform in public with his brother Pepe, who sang flamenco.
 
Paco de Lucia's career took off when he met the flamenco singer Camaron de la Isla in 1968. They formed a musical partnership that lasted until Camaron's death in 1992, and they recorded 10 albums together that revolutionized flamenco. They introduced new elements, such as electric bass, percussion and saxophone, and they experimented with different genres, such as rock, jazz and blues. They also wrote their own lyrics and melodies, breaking away from the traditional flamenco repertoire.
 
Paco de Lucia also pursued a solo career, and he became one of the most influential and acclaimed guitarists in the world. He collaborated with artists from different backgrounds, such as Al Di Meola, John McLaughlin, Chick Corea and Bryan Adams. He composed original music for films, such as Carmen (1983) and The Hit (1984). He won several awards, such as the Prince of Asturias Award for Arts (2004), the Gold Medal of Merit in the Fine Arts (1992) and the Grammy Award for Best World Music Album (2004).
