The film is based on the historical event known as the Wushe Incident or the Musha Incident, which was the last major uprising against colonial Japanese forces in Japanese Taiwan. The incident occurred in October 1930, when over 300 Seediq people in the settlement of Musha (Wushe) attacked a Japanese village, killing over 130 Japanese. The attack was triggered by long-term oppression by Japanese authorities, who had snatched lands from indigenous people, enslaved Aboriginal men, and mistreated their women. [^2^]
 
The Japanese responded with a relentless counter-attack, mobilizing over 2,000 troops and police officers, as well as airplanes and poison gas. The Seediq warriors, led by Chief Mona Rudao, fought back with primitive weapons and guerrilla tactics, but were outnumbered and outgunned. The battle lasted for two months, resulting in over 600 Seediq deaths, most of whom committed suicide rather than surrender. The Japanese also massacred surviving members of the families of Aboriginal participants, and forcefully expelled the rest from their home territories. [^2^]
 
The Wushe Incident was a tragic episode in Taiwan's history that exposed the brutality and injustice of Japanese colonial rule. It also demonstrated the spirit and dignity of the Seediq people, who refused to bow down to foreign invaders and chose to die as free men. The incident has been commemorated by various monuments, museums, and cultural events in Taiwan, as well as by a memorial park in Ren'ai Township, Nantou County, where the incident took place. [^3^]
